CodeCrew has an outdated form we use for signing up students. Create a new site using CSS Grid to update our form:

* Include all of the input fields shown in 2019-09-05_121925.png
* Use placeholders where shown
* Make First and Last name required, as well as the checkbox for agreeing to the terms
* Use the proper 'type' field for ```email```, ```password```, and ```birthday```.
* Make sure you can only select one gender for your radio buttons.
